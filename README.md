# EatNeat
by Compiled with Warnings 

## Project Description
EatNeat is a mobile application that allows users to quickly see the carbon footprint of their food.
Users can either take a photo of their food, a nutrition label, or just paste a recipe in and receive 
a grade on how sustainable they're eating. It will provide suggestions to help people be more 
conscientious in their future food choices. EatNeat leverages Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Vision,
and Flutter.

## Impact
EatNeat educates and empowers people to improve their eating habits. Food production is essential for 
our survival, but current practices are far from sustainable. Importantly, some foods (beef, dairy, etc.)
have a significantly larger environmental impact that others. By presenting this information in the simple
format of CO2 emissions, users of the app will be able to lower their impact from eating.
People are faced with choices between different foods everyday at grocery stores, dining halls, and 
more. EatNeat is a simple but powerful tool to help concerned eaters make these choices with the information
they need to work towards sustainability.
